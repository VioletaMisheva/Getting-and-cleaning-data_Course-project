# Getting-and-cleaning-data_Course-project
This depository contains files for the course project on Getting and cleaning data from Coursera.org

The Codebook contains detailed information about the study design, the data collection, the variables used, and
the implemented transformations.

The run_analysis is a .R script of the different tasks involved.

As a backup, I also included a tidydata.txt file. 
More details can be found in each of the files.
